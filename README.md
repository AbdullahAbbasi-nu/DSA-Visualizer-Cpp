# DSA Visualizer in C++

## 🚀 Overview

A **console-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Visualizer** implemented in **C++**, designed to visually demonstrate the step-by-step functioning of:

- **Linked List (Insert, Delete, Search)**
- **Stack (Array & Linked List Implementation)**
- **Queue (Circular Array & Linked List Implementation)**
- **Binary Search Tree (Insert, Delete, Search, Traversals)**
- **Min Heap (Insert, Delete, Heapify)**
- **Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)**

This project helps strengthen **practical DSA skills**, adds a **recruiter-catching project** to your CV, and serves as an interactive learning tool for others studying DSA with C++.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Menu-driven CLI interface for easy navigation.  
✅ Step-by-step visualization on the console for learning.  
✅ Displays element movements during sorting operations.  
✅ Shows comparisons and swaps count for algorithm analysis.  
✅ Modular OOP-based implementation in C++.  
✅ Easily extendable for additional data structures or GUI integration later.
